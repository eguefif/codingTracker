Todo:
there is one more file with process tests that is a double. Carefull, I might have wrote
a test here that should be in the other legit file.

- make test for emacs -> get emacs

-design
	at the beginning, load data from server or localy
	build the tracker language from these data
	each iteration, it update file or server with the new data

- data structure
	should I save each day as different entry? use SQLLite
