Todo:
ProcessTracker:
	write update_process_list() -> This will remove process from language objects.

Tests:
	-refactor process tests
	- make test for emacs -> get emacs
	- test tracking language when a process is stopped. Be sure it stops measuring time

-design
	at the beginning, load data from server or localy
	build the tracker language from these data
	each iteration, it update file or server with the new data

- data structure
	should I save each day as different entry? use SQLLite
