Todo:
test new data class:
	-test when it is a new day
	- test when the day is already there with several day already.
Code the part that connect to the server in the client
-handle signal sigint and sigterm
- the filedata should be able to return all the data from a file, not just a day.
It has to be able to sync with the server in order to update more than one day.

Tests:
	-refactor process tests
	- make test for emacs -> get emacs
	- test tracking language when a process is stopped. Be sure it stops measuring time

-design
	at the beginning, load data from server or localy
	build the tracker language from these data
	each iteration, it update file or server with the new data

- data structure
	should I save each day as different entry? use SQLLite

- Installation:
	It has to create a file data.dat
