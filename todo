Todo:
	- update server
		use an api style to sync data with server. We don't need to handler sync db to db. We just whant to sync the self.sessions in persistence.

	- Sync with server
		Change the way client and server make sure data are synced.
		use a check sum of the last batch. The client can send a checksum along with the number of last entry. The server pull the last entry and calculate the checksum. It
		then respond with either a 1 for OK or something else for not okey. Then the client send everything, the server make sure everything is alright and notify the client.
		When the client get the notification, it delete the data locally.
		If the server is unable to sort it out, it notify the client, the client then ask the user if he can delete the data.
