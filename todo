Todo:
	- Setup just for client
		Remove server question
		Check input
		Make default value work
		Change the way it works, make a data oriented function
	- Modify data structure:
		Problem:
			At the moment, when you stop coding in one language and start again, it will capture the whole span
			starting from the first time you coded in the day to the last time without discarding what happened
			when you took a break.
		Data structure to use:
			- Name: session
			- Date: %j %y
			- Language
			- [starting_time, ending_time]
		Explanation:
			The Persistence class is responsible for the data saving in hard-disk. It will save each session in a sqlite database.
			It checks
	

Acceptance tests

	- Always connected to server
	- Always disconnected to server
