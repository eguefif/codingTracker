Data handling:
The client has a class DataHandler.
This class assure the data won't be lost. It first try to log in the server and update with the last data.
If it can't log, it saves the data locally.

Thus, wee need two remote commands:
-sync: will update all the data it has in a file
-update: will update with a basic languages dictionnary.

The server will be the one sorting out what to update with its local database.
