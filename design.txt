Data handling:
The client has a class DataHandler.
This class assure the data won't be lost. It first try to log in the server and update with the last data.
If it can't log, it saves the data locally.

Thus, wee need two remote commands:
-sync: will update all the data it has in a file
-update: will update with a basic languages dictionnary.

The server will be the one sorting out what to update with its local database.

how it works
Opening:
Read local file and load data.
Update data depending on how long it sleeps.
	-> Try to update the server first
	-> update local file if offline.
	-> If updated works, reset local file

How to check if it updated the server:
- send a random for the update.
- When the server has saved the new file, it send back the number.
